# CNC_error_prediction
Dataset for this project was taken from Kaggle. A detailed presentation for the project is included in the repository.

First of all, data reduction techniques such as analysing with a heatmap, and PCA were used so that prediction speed can be increased, and the calculations an be made in runtime. 

After this, several regression techniques were implemented and analysed for the time taken and the results obtained.
